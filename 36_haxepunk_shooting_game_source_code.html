<p>Over the past 11 days I've been writing a tutorial series on creating a shooter game using Haxe, OpenFL and HaxePunk framework.</p>
<p>This is the final post, which contains links to the full source code and assets, as well as links to separate tutorial parts.</p>
<p>After following all the tutorial parts you will end up with a fully functional shooter game.</p>
<p>This aim of this tutorial series was to acquaint you with the basics of almost every aspect of the HaxePunk framework.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the list of features that our game now has:</p><ol>
<li>Player's ship can be moved using the arrow keys.</li>
<li>Shoot by holding the space bar.</li>
<li>Destroy enemy ships for score.</li>
<li>Colliding an enemy ship results in a life loss.</li>
<li>The game is lost when there are no lives left, and can be restarted using the enter key.</li>
<li>The game can be paused at any time using the P key.</li>
<li>The game stores player's highscore locally, so it is saved even if you close and re-open the game.</li>
<li>Power ups can be collected for additional lives.</li>
<li>The game has stereo audio effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the source code and assets can now be found at the <a href="https://github.com/KirillPoletaev/HaxePunk-shooter-game">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to follow the step-by-step guide on creating this game from scratch, check out the links below.</p>
<p>You'll firstly need to install HaxePunk. The whole process is described <a href="24_haxepunk_tutorial_getting_started.html">in this tutorial</a>.</p>
