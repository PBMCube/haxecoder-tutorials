<p>HaxePunk provides an easy way to save data locally, which can be loaded the next time the game is launched.</p>
<p>Today I'll show you how to use that feature to store highscore locally.</p>
<p>Data saving is done using a built-in class Data and its static methods. This class lets you create objects with unlimited properties of any type, saving them to a locally stored file. In essence, HaxePunk's Data class utilizes OpenFL's SharedObject functionality and simply acts as a wrapper for that class.</p>
<p>Start by going to the Score.hx class and declaring a new "highscore" variable.</p><p>Make it an integer typed variable:</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">private var highscore:Int;</code></pre>
<p>In the constructor we will add 3 lines which will load the previously saved highscore value and update the text on the screen.</p>
<p>You firstly have to load a saved object. If you don't have one, a new one is created for you. You can give it any name you want, in this case I called my object "shooterData". You can access its properties using the read() method.</p>
<p>In this case I load the "highscore" property and apply its value to the highscore variable. There's a second parameter to the read() method, which lets you specify the default value to return if there is no such property yet. Set that to 0.</p>
<p>After that's done, call the reset() method to update the text on the screen.</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">Data.load("shooterData");
highscore = Data.read("highscore", 0);
reset();
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever data need to be updated, use the write() method to update a value of a property. When that's done, you can apply the changes to the file using the save() method.</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">Data.write("highscore", highscore);
Data.save("shooterData");
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever a point is added in the add() method, check whether the current score is bigger than the highscore. If it is, update highscore to the current value.</p>
<p>Don't forget to update the lines that change displayed text field's value.</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">public function add(num:Int) {
	points += num;
	if (points &gt; highscore) {
		highscore++;
		Data.write(&quot;highscore&quot;, highscore);
		Data.save(&quot;shooterData&quot;);
	}
	score.text = &quot;Score: &quot; + points + &quot;\nHi-score: &quot; + highscore;
}

public function reset() {
	points = 0;
	score.text = &quot;Score: &quot; + points + &quot;\nHi-score: &quot; + highscore;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Full Score.hx class code looks like this:</p>

<p>If you test your game now, you'll see that you have a new "highscore" value displayed. When that value is updated, you can reload the game and see that the value is still there, unchanged.</p><footer>&copy; Kirill Poletaev</footer></body></html>
