<p>HaxeUI is an OpenFL-based UI library.</p>
<p>You can use it in any OpenFL project to quickly add complex interface components to your application or game. All components are completely skinnable.</p>
<p>In this tutorial I'll show you how to install the library and create a simple application with a button.</p>
<p>Accomplishing this is actually not as obvious as it sounds, because HaxeUI components are not added directly to the display list using addChild(), but employ a Toolkit system which lets you create a number of "root" containers (usually just one) for drawing and managing all the UI controls.</p><p>To download HaxeUI, you can use haxelib.</p>
<pre><code>haxelib install haxeui</code></pre>
<p>Create an OpenFL project using the default template and add haxeui to the used libraries in application.xml:</p>
<pre><code class="xml">&lt;haxelib name=&quot;haxeui&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Go to the init() function and initialize HaxeUI by calling a static init() function of the Toolkit class:</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">Toolkit.init();</code></pre>
<p>As I said above, you don't add UI controls to the display list - they are supposed to be added to a root, which is a core component (that I will cover in detail later) that is created asynchronously by the HaxeUI toolkit system.</p>
<p>Usually, one root is enough for most applications. It is created using the static openFullscreen() method of the Toolkit class, and receives a function as the parameter, which is called asynchronously to create all the UI components.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">Toolkit.openFullscreen(function(root:Root) {

});
</code></pre>
<p>Adding UI controls is very straight forward.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's an example with a button and a click listener, which changes the button's label when it's clicked:</p>
<pre><code class="haxe">Toolkit.openFullscreen(function(root:Root) {
	var b:Button = new Button();
	b.text = &quot;Test button&quot;;
	b.x = 10;
	b.y = 10;
	root.addChild(b);
	
	b.addEventListener(UIEvent.CLICK, function(evt:UIEvent) {
		evt.component.text = &quot;Clicked&quot;;
	});
});
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that I used the root object, which is passed as a parameter of the function, to add the button using the addChild() method.</p>
<p>You can build your interface just like that - by adding components to the root programmatically.</p>
<p>Another way is to store UI layouts in XML files. I'll cover that in the next tutorial.</p><footer>&copy; Kirill Poletaev</footer></body></html>
